# Composio Authentication Issue - Workaround

## Problem
`composio login` returns "Request failed with status code 410"

This indicates the CLI login endpoint may have changed or the CLI version is outdated.

## Solutions

### Solution 1: Update Composio CLI
```bash
npm uninstall -g composio-core
npm install -g composio-core@latest
composio --version
composio login
```

### Solution 2: Use API Key Directly
Instead of CLI login, you can use the API key directly in your code (which is already configured in `.env`):

Your `.env` already has:
```env
COMPOSIO_API_KEY=ak_jJA9ebA6y0M5eYoIuaZA
```

This is sufficient for the application to work!

### Solution 3: Use Composio Dashboard
1. Go to https://app.composio.dev
2. Log in to your account
3. Click on "Integrations" in the sidebar
4. Connect Gmail, Slack, and Notion directly from the dashboard
5. Your `COMPOSIO_API_KEY` will work with these connections

### Solution 4: Alternative Integration Methods

Since Composio CLI is having issues, you have these options:

#### Option A: Use Native SDKs (Recommended)
Instead of Composio, use the native SDKs directly:

**For Gmail:**
```bash
npm install @googleapis/gmail
```

**For Slack:**
```bash
npm install @slack/web-api @slack/bolt
```

**For Notion:**
```bash
npm install @notionhq/client
```

These are already in your `package.json`! You can use them directly.

#### Option B: Manual OAuth Setup
1. **Gmail**: Set up OAuth in Google Cloud Console
2. **Slack**: Create Slack App and get tokens
3. **Notion**: Create Notion integration

Your `.env` already has these credentials configured!

## Quick Fix: Use Mock Data Mode

Your application works perfectly with mock data! You don't need real integrations to test the dashboard:

```bash
# Just start the app
npm start

# Dashboard will work with mock data
# Open: http://localhost:5173
```

## Recommended Approach

Given the Composio CLI issue, I recommend:

1. **For Development/Testing**: Use mock data mode (works now!)
2. **For Production**: Implement direct SDK integrations

### Implementing Direct SDK Integration

I can help you create a version that uses the native SDKs instead of Composio. This would:

✅ Avoid Composio CLI issues
✅ Give you more control
✅ Use the credentials you already have in `.env`
✅ Work immediately

Would you like me to:
1. Create a version using native Gmail/Slack/Notion SDKs?
2. Or continue troubleshooting Composio CLI?

## Check Your Setup

Let's verify what you have:

```bash
# Check if Composio CLI is installed
composio --version

# Check Node version
node --version

# Check if API key is set
echo %COMPOSIO_API_KEY%
```

## Alternative: Skip Composio Entirely

Since you have direct API credentials in `.env`:
- `GMAIL_CLIENT_ID` and `GMAIL_CLIENT_SECRET`
- `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`
- `NOTION_API_KEY`

You can use these directly without Composio! I can create an alternative integration file that uses these native credentials.

## Next Steps

**Choose your path:**

**Path A: Fix Composio** (if you need Composio specifically)
```bash
npm install -g composio-core@latest
composio login
```

**Path B: Use Native SDKs** (recommended - works now!)
- I'll create `src/integrations/native-client.ts`
- Uses Gmail, Slack, Notion APIs directly
- No Composio dependency

**Path C: Use Mock Data** (easiest - already working!)
```bash
npm start
# Dashboard works perfectly with mock data
```

Which path would you like to take?
