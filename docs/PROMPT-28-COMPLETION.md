## Architecture

### Signal Conversion Flow

```
EventHub Events → Event Subscriber → Signal Format → Reasoning Pipeline → Action
```

#### 1. Gmail Signal Conversion
```typescript
gmail:new_message → Signal {
  id: "gmail-{messageId}",
  source: "email",
  subject: emailData.subject,
  body: emailData.body || emailData.snippet,
  sender: emailData.from,
  timestamp: emailData.timestamp
}
```

#### 2. Slack Signal Conversion
```typescript
slack:new_message → Signal {
  id: "slack-{messageId}",
  source: "slack",
  subject: "Message in #{channelName}",
  body: messageData.text,
  sender: messageData.username || messageData.userId,
  timestamp: messageData.timestamp
}
```

#### 3. Google Sheets Signal Conversion
```typescript
sheets:data_changed → Signal {
  id: "sheet-{spreadsheetId}-{timestamp}",
  source: "sheets",
  subject: "{changeType} in {spreadsheetName}",
  body: "Sheet: {sheetName} | Range: {range} | Change: {changeType}...",
  sender: sheetData.user,
  timestamp: sheetData.timestamp
}
```

### Rate Limiting Strategy

**Algorithm:** Token Bucket with 60-second sliding window

```typescript
Rate Limiter {
  processedCount: number,  // Signals processed in current window
  windowStart: number,     // Window start timestamp
  maxPerMinute: 10         // Maximum signals per minute (configurable)
}
```

**Behavior:**
- Tracks signals processed in 60-second windows
- Blocks processing when limit reached
- Automatically resets after window expires
- Non-blocking: waits asynchronously for window reset

### Queue Management

**Priority System:**
- High priority: 3
- Normal priority: 2  
- Low priority: 1

**Overflow Handling:**
- Maximum queue size: 100 (configurable)
- When full: drops lowest priority signal
- Sorts queue by priority before processing
- Tracks dropped signals in statistics

### Reconnection Logic

**Strategy:** Exponential backoff with max attempts

```typescript
Reconnection {
  interval: 5000ms,           // Wait time between attempts
  maxAttempts: 10,            // Give up after 10 failures
  currentAttempts: 0          // Reset on successful reconnect
}
```

**Triggers:**
- EventHub 'error' events
- Connection loss detection
- Failed event subscriptions

---

## API Reference

### Starting the Subscriber

```typescript
import { startListening } from './agents/event-subscriber';

// Start with default config
startListening();

// Start with custom config
startListening({
  maxSignalsPerMinute: 20,
  maxQueueSize: 200,
  reconnectInterval: 10000,
  maxReconnectAttempts: 5,
  verboseLogging: true
});
```

### Stopping the Subscriber

```typescript
import { stopListening } from './agents/event-subscriber';

// Stop listening and unsubscribe
stopListening();
```

### Getting Statistics

```typescript
import { getSubscriberStats } from './agents/event-subscriber';

const stats = getSubscriberStats();
console.log(stats);
// Output:
// {
//   signalsProcessed: 250,
//   signalsQueued: 260,
//   signalsDropped: 10,
//   gmailSignals: 150,
//   slackSignals: 80,
//   sheetSignals: 20,
//   errors: 5,
//   avgProcessingTime: 175,
//   rateLimitHits: 15,
//   reconnections: 2,
//   uptime: 1800000
// }
```

### Queue Management

```typescript
import { getQueueSize, clearQueue } from './agents/event-subscriber';

// Get current queue depth
const size = getQueueSize();

// Emergency queue flush
clearQueue();
```

## Configuration Options

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `maxSignalsPerMinute` | number | 10 | Rate limit for signal processing |
| `maxQueueSize` | number | 100 | Maximum signals in queue before overflow |
| `reconnectInterval` | number | 5000 | Milliseconds between reconnection attempts |
| `maxReconnectAttempts` | number | 10 | Max reconnection tries before giving up |
| `verboseLogging` | boolean | false | Enable detailed logs for debugging |

---

## Statistics Tracked

### Signal Metrics
- **signalsProcessed**: Total signals processed successfully
- **signalsQueued**: Total signals added to queue
- **signalsDropped**: Signals dropped due to overflow
- **gmailSignals**: Gmail-specific signal count
- **slackSignals**: Slack-specific signal count
- **sheetSignals**: Sheets-specific signal count

### Performance Metrics
- **avgProcessingTime**: Average processing time per signal (ms)
- **errors**: Total error count
- **rateLimitHits**: Number of times rate limit was reached
- **reconnections**: Reconnection attempt count
- **uptime**: Total time subscriber has been running (ms)

---

## Error Handling

### Signal Processing Errors
- **Retry Logic**: Up to 3 attempts per signal
- **Failure Handling**: Logs error, updates statistics, continues processing
- **Error Tracking**: All errors recorded in statistics

### EventHub Connection Errors
- **Auto-Reconnection**: Automatically attempts to reconnect
- **Backoff Strategy**: Waits between attempts (configurable interval)
- **Max Attempts**: Gives up after configured max attempts
- **State Preservation**: Queued signals remain intact during reconnection

### Rate Limit Handling
- **Non-Blocking**: Asynchronously waits for window reset
- **Statistics**: Tracks rate limit hits
- **Queue Behavior**: Signals wait in queue during rate limit

---

## Integration with Reasoning Pipeline

### Signal Processing Flow

```
1. Event received from EventHub
   ↓
2. Convert to standardized Signal format
   ↓
3. Add to priority queue
   ↓
4. Check rate limit
   ↓
5. Process via reasoning pipeline
   ↓
6. Emit reasoning:complete event
   ↓
7. Update statistics
```

### Reasoning Pipeline Integration

```typescript
// Inside processSignal()
const result = await processSignal(queuedSignal.signal);

// Emit result
await eventHub.emitEvent({
  source: 'reasoning-pipeline',
  type: 'reasoning:complete',
  data: {
    signalId: queuedSignal.signal.id,
    signalSource: queuedSignal.signal.source,
    result: result,
    processingTime: endTime - startTime,
  },
  priority: queuedSignal.priority,
});
```
