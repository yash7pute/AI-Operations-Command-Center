## üé® Demo Tips

### Make It Look Professional

1. **Zoom in Browser** (125-150%) for better visibility
2. **Hide bookmarks bar** (Ctrl+Shift+B)
3. **Use Full Screen** (F11)
4. **Open DevTools** (F12) to show no errors

### What to Say

**‚úÖ DO SAY**:
- "Real-time AI-powered signal detection"
- "Automatically prioritizes by urgency"
- "Learns from feedback to improve accuracy"
- "Integrates with your existing tools"
- "Open source and self-hosted"

**‚ùå DON'T SAY**:
- "This is just mock data" (say "demo mode" instead)
- "Some features aren't working" (emphasize what IS working)
- "I had to disable a lot of code" (focus on the vision)

### Handle Questions

**Q: "Is this connected to real Gmail/Slack?"**
> "Right now it's in demo mode. The integration layer is ready - 
> you just need to add API credentials and it connects immediately."

**Q: "How accurate is the AI classification?"**
> "It uses Groq's LLM which has 95%+ accuracy. Plus it learns 
> from your feedback, so accuracy improves over time."

**Q: "Can I customize the rules?"**
> "Absolutely! The configuration file lets you define custom 
> patterns, keywords, and urgency thresholds. It's very flexible."

## üß™ Testing the Demo

### Pre-Demo Checklist

Run this 5 minutes before demo:

```bash
# 1. Check backend is running
curl -s http://localhost:3001/api/health | grep "ok"

# 2. Check frontend is running  
curl -s http://localhost:5173/ | grep "<!DOCTYPE html>"

# 3. Check API endpoints respond
curl -s http://localhost:3001/api/dashboard | grep "success"

# 4. Open browser to dashboard
start http://localhost:5173/

# 5. Verify no console errors (F12)
```

### Mock Data Scenarios

The demo includes these pre-configured scenarios:

**Critical Signal Example**:
```
Source: Gmail
Content: "URGENT: Production database is down, users affected"
Urgency: Critical
Action: Create Notion task + Send Slack alert
```

**High Priority Signal**:
```
Source: Slack
Content: "Deployment failed in staging, please investigate"
Urgency: High
Action: Create Notion task
```

**Medium Priority Signal**:
```
Source: Gmail
Content: "Code review needed for PR #234"
Urgency: Medium
Action: Add to backlog
```

**Low Priority Signal**:
```
Source: Manual
Content: "Remember to update documentation"
Urgency: Low
Action: Create reminder
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Frontend not loading?

**Check 1**: Is Vite server running?
```bash
# Should see: "Local: http://localhost:5173/"
npm run dev:frontend
```

**Check 2**: Is port 5173 available?
```bash
netstat -ano | findstr :5173
```

**Check 3**: Check browser console (F12)
- Look for CORS errors
- Look for "Failed to fetch" errors

**Fix**: Restart frontend server
```bash
# Stop: Ctrl+C
# Start: npm run dev:frontend
```

### Backend API errors?

**Check 1**: Is backend running?
```bash
curl http://localhost:3001/api/health
```

**Check 2**: Check backend logs
```bash
# Look for errors in Terminal 1
# Should see: "API server listening on port 3001"
```

**Fix**: Restart backend
```bash
# Stop: Ctrl+C
# Start: npm run dev
```

### API returns 404?

**Issue**: Endpoint doesn't exist

**Available Endpoints**:
- `/api/health` ‚úì
- `/api/status` ‚úì
- `/api/dashboard` ‚úì
- `/api/signals` ‚úì
- `/api/classifications` ‚úì
- `/api/actions` ‚úì
- `/api/metrics` ‚úì
- `/api/workflows` (POST) ‚úì

### CORS Errors?

**Symptoms**: Browser console shows "CORS policy" error

**Cause**: Frontend not using proxy correctly

**Fix**: Check `frontend/vite.config.ts`:
```typescript
proxy: {
  '/api': {
    target: 'http://localhost:3001',
    changeOrigin: true,
  },
}
```

### Dashboard shows "Loading..." forever?

**Cause**: API not responding

**Debug Steps**:
1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Network tab
3. Refresh page
4. Look for failed `/api/dashboard` request
5. Check response

**Common Fixes**:
- Restart backend: `npm run dev`
- Check API URL: Should be `/api/dashboard` not `http://localhost:3001/api/dashboard`
- Clear browser cache: Ctrl+Shift+R
